# Feature Specification: SDD Commands Implementation

## Overview
Implement the three core SDD commands (/specify, /plan, /tasks) as Cursor IDE commands to enable structured software development workflow.

## Problem Statement
### What problem are we solving?
- Developers often jump straight into coding without proper planning
- Requirements are unclear or incomplete, leading to scope creep
- Teams lack structured approach to feature development
- Documentation is often an afterthought, not integrated into workflow

### Who are the affected users?
- Software developers using Cursor IDE
- Development teams working on collaborative projects
- Project managers needing visibility into development progress
- Technical leads requiring structured development processes

### Why is this important?
- Reduces development time through better planning
- Improves code quality through structured approach
- Enhances team collaboration and communication
- Ensures alignment between requirements and implementation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: `/specify` command creates detailed feature specifications
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: 
    - Command accepts feature name and description
    - Generates spec.md with requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
    - Creates organized directory structure for feature
    - Validates input and provides helpful error messages

- **FR-002**: `/plan` command generates technical implementation plans
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Reads existing specification file
    - Creates comprehensive technical plan with architecture
    - Includes technology stack recommendations
    - Considers security and performance requirements

- **FR-003**: `/tasks` command breaks down plans into actionable tasks
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Reads existing plan and specification files
    - Creates discrete, manageable development tasks
    - Includes effort estimates and dependencies
    - Defines clear success criteria for each task

- **FR-004**: Template system for consistent documentation
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Supports customizable templates for each document type
    - Processes variables and conditional content
    - Maintains consistent formatting and structure
    - Allows template modifications and extensions

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Commands should execute within 2 seconds
- **Usability**: Clear error messages and usage guidance
- **Maintainability**: Modular code structure with separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new commands and templates

## User Stories

### US-001: Create Feature Specification
**As a** developer  
**I want** to use `/specify` command with feature description  
**So that** I can create comprehensive requirements before coding

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Command creates new feature directory with unique numbering
- Generates spec.md with structured requirements template
- Prompts for additional details if description is incomplete
- Updates project index with new feature

**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium

### US-002: Generate Technical Plan
**As a** developer  
**I want** to use `/plan` command on existing specification  
**So that** I can create detailed technical implementation strategy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Command requires existing spec.md file
- Generates plan.md with architecture and technology decisions
- Considers existing project constraints and patterns
- Provides technology stack recommendations with justifications

**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium

### US-003: Create Implementation Tasks
**As a** developer  
**I want** to use `/tasks` command on existing plan  
**So that** I can break down work into manageable development tasks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Command requires existing plan.md file
- Generates tasks.md with prioritized task breakdown
- Includes effort estimates and dependencies
- Creates progress tracking template

**Priority:** High  
**Effort:** Medium

### US-004: Progress Tracking
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to see development progress for each feature  
**So that** I can track project status and identify blockers

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Each feature has progress.md file with current status
- Index page shows overview of all features and their status
- Status updates are easy to maintain and accurate
- Clear visibility into completed vs remaining work

**Priority:** Medium  
**Effort:** Small

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in development time by 20% through better planning
- Increase in code quality (measured by reduced bugs/rework)
- Improved team collaboration (measured by developer feedback)
- Higher completion rate of features within original scope

## Edge Cases & Error Scenarios
- **Invalid feature name**: Provide clear naming guidelines
- **Missing dependencies**: Check for required files before execution
- **Duplicate feature names**: Warn user and suggest alternatives
- **Corrupted templates**: Validate template files and provide defaults
- **Permission issues**: Clear error messages for file system problems

## Dependencies
- Cursor IDE command system
- File system access for creating/reading files
- Template processing engine
- Project directory structure conventions

## Assumptions
- Users have Cursor IDE installed and configured
- Project follows standard directory structures
- Developers are familiar with markdown format
- Git version control is used for tracking changes

## Out of Scope
- Integration with external project management tools (phase 2)
- Advanced template IDE features (phase 2)
- Multi-language template support (phase 2)
- Real-time collaboration features (phase 2)

- [x] Requirements are clear and testable
- [x] User stories follow INVEST criteria
- [x] Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable
- [x] Edge cases are identified and addressed
- [x] Dependencies are documented
- [x] Success metrics are defined
